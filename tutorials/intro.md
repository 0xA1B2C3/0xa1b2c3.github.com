# Intro

Python is an incredibly useful tool that can be used in extremely diverse ways. Some of its uses include:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Complex math models
- Simple video games
- Web bots
- Hosting web sites

These uses are fantastic projects, but the greatest benefit in learning Python is how it changes your view of the world. 
After learning about the fundamentals of Computer Science, you hopefully will not look at the world in the same way. 
In my experience, I found that computer science helped my understanding of math and vice versa. 
There is something universal about the two topics that transcends physical computers, like the concepts of vectors and operations on data. 
Hopefully you will learn to see Computer Science not as a field with a goal of making computers do our jobs, but as a field that allows us to make sense of the world.

# Overview

I like to divide computers into 2 concepts:

- Data (Memories)
- Operations (Thinking and Actions)

Data are the memories of the computer, like human memories except in binary code. Operations are what the computer does, and you can think of them as what the computer thinks about and acts out. My tutorials will cover both of these aspects of programming; you will learn how to write operations to manipulate data. 

Some people drop the activity of learning programming because they think it is too hard. It might look daunting at first, but I assure you that the rewards of learning this skill are great. It is important to know that the rewards of programming mostly come after the learning process, so don't give up hope if you think that you aren't doing anything useful. You only truely realize the uses of programming after you have learned it!
