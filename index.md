# Intro

Python is an incredibly useful tool that can be used in extremely diverse ways. Some of its uses include:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Complex math models
- Simple video games
- Web bots
- Hosting web sites

These uses are fantastic projects, but the greatest benefit in learning Python is how it changes your view of the world. After learning about the fundamentals of Computer Science, you hopefully will not look at the world in the same way. In my experience, I found that computer science helped my understanding of math and vice versa. There is something universal about the two topics that transcends physical computers, like the concepts of vectors and operations on data. Hopefully you will learn to see Computer Science not as a field with a goal of making computers do our jobs, but as a field that allows us to make sense of the world.

# Overview

I like to divide computers into 2 concepts:

- Data (Memories)
- Operations (Thinking)

Data are the memories of the computer. Computer memories are divided into 2 categories (for simplicityâ€™s sake): short-term and long term memory.
